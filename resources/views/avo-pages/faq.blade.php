      <p class="faq">An Alliance Virtual Office combines   People, Place and Technology as the basis for a complete virtual office.
      These   essential elements offer mobile and work-from-home professionals an experienced   live receptionist to answer their phone,
      a place to meet or spend a day in a   professional office space and a start-of-the-art virtual phone system. </p><br />
      <p class="mediumBold"><a name="3" id="3"></a><span class="mediumBold gray1">What is a CMRA form and why do I need to complete it for my virtual office?</span></p>

      and we adhere closely to the US Postal regulation that all of our clients who use one of our addresses in the

      <p class="mediumBold"><a name="4" id="4"></a><span class="mediumBold gray1">What is a Virtual Phone   System?</span></p>
      <p class="faq">A virtual phone system goes by many   names: VoIP phone, Virtual PBX, Virtual PBX Phone System, Small Business Phone
      System, etc. Whatever the name, our feature-rich virtual phone system allows users to set up a Fortune 500 type phone system for less.
      From conference calls   to dial by name directories, our phone system has it all. Best of all it can be   managed by a non-technical person through our intuitive web interface.</p><br />

      <p class="mediumBold"><a name="5" id="5"></a><span class="mediumBold gray1">How Does the Live Receptionist   Service Work?</span></p>
      <p class="faq">Our experienced, professional live   receptionists have all been extensively trained to answer phones for a variety
      of companies, yet still answer each call in a personalized way. Once you are a client of Alliance, you can login to your Alliance
      management system and tell us   exactly how you want your phone to be answered. Give us explicit instructions on   how to answer
      your phone, where you are, where to reach you, etc. You can even   tailor our responses depending on who calls. Every time someone calls your
       number our software will display this information to our receptionists.
       Additionally, our receptionists get to know each of our clients (and their   frequent callers) and become familiar with
       the types of calls received. This   focus enables us to serve our clients better.</p><br />

      <p class="mediumBold"><a name="6" id="6"></a><span class="mediumBold gray1">How Does Alliance Count Live Answering Minutes?</span></p>
      <p class="faq">Alliance counts Live Answering minutes by the second and we never round up!<br />You can view your Live Answering minutes in real-time through our client admin system.</p><br />

      <p class="mediumBold"><a name="7" id="7"></a><span class="mediumBold gray1">How Does Alliance Count Virtual   Phone System Minutes?</span></p>
      <p class="faq">Alliance does not count any calls against our clients' minutes if they are 5 seconds or less. Other than that, our system counts 30 second increments so a 25 second call is
      30 seconds and a 55 second call is counted as 1 minute. Please note that these minutes are counted separately from our Live Answering system.</p><br /><br />
