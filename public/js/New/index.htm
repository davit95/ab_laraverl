			<h1>What People Are Saying About Virtual Offices</h1>
			<p>Finding and buying a virtual office was so easy. There are many virtual offices to choose from and quite a few options for virtual offices in New York. Having a virtual office has cut my expenses drastically but does not make me compromise on our company's image. And the automated phone system and virtual receptionist service is an unexpected bonus.</p>

			<h1>What People Are Saying About Virtual Offices</h1>
			<p>Having a virtual receptionist along with a phone system helps me run my business more efficiently. I don't have to answer every call that comes in, but in my line of business I can’t afford for the calls to go straight to voicemail, so the virtual office is the perfect solution. I also occasionally visit with clients in or just stop over in my new Chicago office space.</p>

			<p>I needed someone to answer my calls, but was interested in something more than the standard call answering package, so I found this live receptionist solution would match my needs perfectly. And for just a little bit more per month I could have a fully featured PBX phone system with every bell and whistle I can imagine. This is the perfect virtual office for my business in Washington, DC.</p>

			<h1>What People Are Saying About Virtual Offices</h1>
			<p>A friend told me about virtual offices and how many good options there are in Houston. Between the virtual receptionists and the great locations in Downtown Houston, I have everything thing I need. While I enjoy having a virtual receptionist screen and forward my calls, I find the phone system to be a tremendous benefit with its myriad options.</p>

			<h1>What People Are Saying About Virtual Offices</h1>
			<p>I spent a lot of time searching for just the right virtual office in Miami, and finally found just the right mix of options. I started out with just a business address and mail forwarding. After a few months, it was very easy to add a number of other services such as live answering, voicemail and call forwarding. I even added a vanity toll-free number and a couple extensions without a problem!</p>
